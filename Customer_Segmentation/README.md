## ▶️ How to Run This Project

1. Install required packages:
2. Run the Streamlit app:
3. ## 🎯 Output
The model classifies customers into different segments and displays the predicted cluster.

## 📊 Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning (K-Means)

This project segments customers based on:
- Price
- Freight value
- Review score
- Purchase year & month
- Estimated delivery days
- Order approval days
- Shipping time
- Order approval hour

✅ Preprocessing using StandardScaler  
✅ Clustering using K-Means  
✅ Model saved using Pickle  
✅ Deployed using Streamlit Cloud  

### 🧠 Output:
The model predicts customer cluster and provides business interpretation like:
- Fast shipping + low price
- Slow shipping + high price
- Medium behavior customers
